## Etta's 2023 Science Fair Project In Celsius

The goal of this project was to play around with existing sensors and build something them them together.

This project makes use of:
- Temperature Sensor
- Proxmity Sensor
- RGB LED
- Single LEDs

The program is pretty simple:
1. only operate if someone is standing in front
2. measure the temperature of the probe in Celsius.  (users can squeeze it to heat it up)
3. display the value the temperature using the RGB and single LEDs.

### Interpreting the Temperature
- The single LEDs turn on at 10, 20, and 30 celsius thresholds
- The RGB LED will change color from blue -> red representing 0-9 degrees celsius

Together the system is capable of representing 0 - 39 degrees Celsius.
